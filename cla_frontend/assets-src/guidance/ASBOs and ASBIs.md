Anyone over the age of 10 can be given an Antisocial Behaviour Order (ASBO) or Antisocial Behaviour Injunction (ASBI) if they behave antisocially.

Behaving antisocially includes:

* drunken or threatening behaviour
* vandalism and graffiti
* playing loud music at night

##Possible scenarios 

A client may have been served an ABO or ASBI by the County Court, which they want to challenge. 

They may also be calling for advice because their social landlord has said they intend to seek an ASBO or ASBI.  

For ASBOs and ASBIs, the client must have a social landlord. Only social landlords (including local councils, housing action trusts and registered social landlords can apply for an ASBO or ASBI. Private landlords can't.
