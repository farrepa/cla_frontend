#Family mediation
You should suggest that the caller considers family mediation if you have diagnosed that:

* they have a private law family dispute about money, property or children, and
* there are no concerns about domestic violence or child abuse, and
* the problem is not otherwise in scope for legal aid

##Why use mediation? (a reminder)
Mediation can be a helpful way of resolving issues about money or arrangements for children. It can be quicker and cheaper than going to court and much less stressful for everyone involved. 

##What should you (the operator) tell clients about mediation?

First ask if the caller has heard of mediation and check that they understand what it is. 

If the caller does not have a clear understanding of mediation, you should use the following messages:

"In mediation, you and your family members can explain your concerns and needs to each other. The mediator will give you a safe and neutral setting to talk in and they won't take sides."

"Family mediators are trained to work with people whose relationships have broken down. They will listen to both sides of the argument and help you to reach your own agreement."

Then you can explain about the link with legal aid, as follows:

"If you are eligible you can get legal aid for family mediation as well as legal advice to support the mediation process. This can include the cost of making any agreement that you reach in mediation legally binding by applying to the court - this is called applying for a consent order."

"The court will expect you to attend a 'mediation information and assessment meeting' if, after separating from your partner, you are applying for a court order about:

* money
* property
* possessions, or 
* arrangements about children

If you haven't been to one of these meetings the court may ask you to do so before it proceeds with your case."

##Where should you direct clients for mediation?
You can then direct clients to their nearest contracted quality assured family mediation service using the directory (Find An Adviser tool).
