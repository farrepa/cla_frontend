## Subject Matter of Dispute (SMOD) guidance

A property is only in dispute in family cases if it is the ownership of the property that is in dispute - this does not include any arguments over who should live in the property.

You should record an asset (property or savings) based on how it is currently held or registered, not on what each party is hoping to achieve if they are successful at the end of the case. For example, if the client hopes to gain a share in an ex-partner's savings account but the account is not registered in the client's name, you should not include this under 'disputed savings'.

In a family dispute where the former matrimonial home is SMOD, if the client is seeking 50% of the property but the property is currently registered in the opponent’s sole name, treat the client’s interest in the asset as nil and do not include the asset under the client's property.

SMOD only applies to capital assets (disputed property and disputed savings). Income cannot be regarded as SMOD since the issue here is simply whether the client is currently receiving the income or not. For example if the client is challenging the level of maintenance they are receiving ie seeking an increased amount, just include the amount currently being received in the assessment.
