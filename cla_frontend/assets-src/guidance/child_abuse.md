##Definition of child abuse

Child abuse is physical or mental abuse, including sexual abuse and abuse in the form of violence, neglect, maltreatment and exploitation. A child is someone aged under 18.

##Common scenarios

* the child has witnessed conflict between the parties 
* the child has been allocated a social worker
* a parent has been allocated a social worker
* an incident between the parties has been reported to the police – this can be easy to miss as a parent might not appreciate that an incident between the parents can cause a child any harm – this would be considered as emotional harm
* Social Services has been involved with the family in the past 
* there has been court proceedings involving the child 
* the child is receiving counselling, therapy or psychiatric help
