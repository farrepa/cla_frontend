** Repeat Clients/Callers

To protect the privacy of our users you must ensure that you do not disclose that there is an existing case record or any details about the existing case until you have verified the identity of the user.

Where a user states that they have contacted the service before you must get them to reconfirm a minimum of two pieces of personal information.

This must include their full name.

And one of the following: - full address and postcode
* date of birth
* NI number or
* phone number.

If the user does not initially reconfirm the second piece of personal data correctly you may, where possible, ask them for one other additional piece of personal data. For example, if a client states their name but is unsure of their address because they have moved around a lot then ask for a contact telephone number that may have been provided.

If the user answers a minimum of 2 questions correctly then check to see if they are calling about their previous issue.

If the user is unable to answer 2 questions cirrectly, do not disclose that there is a case to the caller. You must then open a new case.


** Repeat Caller/User - Third Party

To protect the privacy of our users you must ensure that where a third party states that they are calling on behalf of someone else and have used the service before you must not disclose that there is an existing case record or any of the details until you have verified the identity of both the third party and the user.

Where a third party states that they are authorised to contact the service and have done so before you must get them to:

reconfirm a minimum of two pieces of personal information about BOTH themselves AND the client this must include both their full names.
And one piece of the following for BOTH themselves and the client: - full address and postcode
* date of birth
* NI number or
* phone number.

They MUST also be able to confirm the agreed Passphrase.

If you verify the Third Party details check to see if they are calling about a previous issue.

If you cannot verify the details of the Third Party AND the matter is urgent you must open a new case.
