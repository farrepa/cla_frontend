##Questions to ask

###Repossession of someone's home due to failure to make mortgage repayments

* Are you the owner or joint owner of the property? (If not,  then likely to be Housing)

• Is your home being reposessed because you are behind with mortgage repayments? 

• Is the property your sole residence? (Look out for clients who have moved out of the home they 

own as they could not keep up with payments and now live elsewhere.)

• Have you received paperwork from the court? If so, what stage are court proceedings at? 

• If there are no court proceedings, why do you think you might lose your home?

• What type of loan do you have on the property - is it a mortgage, secured loan or an all-monies charge?

###Court order for sale of an individual’s home

• Is a court ordering you to sell your home to repay a debt?

• Do you live at the property?

• Have you received court paperwork? (This must be an application for an Order for Sale, not just a 

county court judgment or a charging order.)

###Bankruptcy orders against the client where the estate includes their home (and 

where they did not apply for bankruptcy themselves)

• Is someone trying to make you bankrupt because you owe them money? If you are made 

bankrupt would you lose your home? 

• Are you the person who has been declared bankrupt? (Or do you just live in the property?)

• Did you apply for your own bankruptcy?

• Is the property in question actually where you live?
