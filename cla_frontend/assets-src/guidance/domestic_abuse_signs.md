* The caller has reported incidents to the police

* The caller has spoken to any professional about difficulties at home

* The caller has applied for injunctions or protection orders in the past

## Signs of child abuse 

* The child has witnessed conflict between the parties

* The child has been allocated a social worker

* The child is receiving counselling, therapy or psychiatric help
