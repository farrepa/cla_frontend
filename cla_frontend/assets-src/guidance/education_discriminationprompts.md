##Discrimination in education
It's important to find out if there is a potential discrimination case in any education problem. Use the operator questions, and if you identify discrimination select 'confirm' to continue with the diagnosis. If you don't identify discrimination then select 'NO' to close the case as an out of scope education matter. 

The table below contains examples of discrimination cases and the questions you could ask the caller to get the information you need to diagnose the problem.

| Client situation | You could ask... |
|---|---|
| A school is planning a trip but excludes the caller's child. This is because the child is disabled and the school believes the child will not be able to adequately participate. | Do you think your child has been singled out, treated differently or experienced worse treatment than someone else? Was there a particular reason why your child was excluded from the school trip? |
| A pupil reports that they are being bullied and the school is taking no action. they have told the school they believe this is due to them being gay. | Do you think you have been singled out, treated differently or experienced worse treatment than someone else? Why do you think you are being bullied? |
| A school is not willing to adapt their school uniform to meet the needs of disabled children |
