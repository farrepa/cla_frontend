##Discrimination in education
It's important to find out if there is a potential discrimination case in any education problem. Use the operator questions, and if you identify discrimination select 'confirm' to continue with the diagnosis. If you don't identify discrimination then select 'NO' to close the case as an out of scope education matter. 

The table below contains examples of discrimination cases and the questions you could ask the caller to get the information you need to diagnose the problem.
