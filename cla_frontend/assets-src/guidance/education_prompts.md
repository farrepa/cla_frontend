##Questions to ask

* do you disagree with how a school, college or council is providing for your child's special educational needs or learning difficulties?
* do you want to challenge the way the school, college or council made a decision about your child's education?
* have you been advised to bring judicial review proceedings on an education matter?
* do you think the school, college or council has treated you or your child unfairly? (to assess if in scope for discrimination)
