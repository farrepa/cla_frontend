## Exemptions to the mandatory gateway

Exemptions only apply to the categories of debt, discrimination and education

The three exemptions are: 
1. Clients who have been deprived of their liberty (e.g. they are in prison or a secure hospital);
1. Children under the age of 18; and
1. Clients who have assessed by the gateway in the previous 12 months as requiring face-to-face advice, who have a further linked problem and are seeking further help from the same face-to-face provider.

An exempt client does not have to access advice remotely. These clients can access face to face advice without going through CLA.

However, if an exempt client calls CLA they should be treated as any other client, with the exemption noted on the system. The client can express a preference for face to face advice at any point during the case.

**If you have a debt exempt client** then you need to determine if they wish to receive advice face-to-face or remotely. If remotely then refer to a CLA Specialist. If face-to-face then offer the client a managed referral to a local debt provider from the Find a legal adviser tool. *(A managed referral is where you contact the Provider on the clientâ€™s behalf - for further info ask your team leader)*

**In discrimination and education**, the only legal aid providers are the CLA providers therefore if a client is exempt, they should be referred to one of the CLA providers who will arrange for a face to face appointment.
