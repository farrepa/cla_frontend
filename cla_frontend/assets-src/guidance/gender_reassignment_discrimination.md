##Handling gender reassignment discrimination cases
In general, you would record the details of the case as for any other in scope matter and use the Matter Type 2 code for gender reassignment. 

However, current practice is that the client must be asked if they are willing to share case details with the specialist and also if they are happy for us to record their details on the CHS.
