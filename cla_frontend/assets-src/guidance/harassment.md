##What is harassment?
Harassment only covers issues about properties that are being rented or leased from another person. Legal aid is available to apply for an injunction or restraining order to protect the client (the tenant) from harassment. 

To decide if the case is in scope, you will need to identify that what the client is describing amount to harassment. The key points to look out for are:

* the perpetrator's actions are causing the client alarm or distress
* the client is in fear of violence
* there have been at least two occasions of the harassing behaviour

"Causing alarm and distress" is very subjective and it is difficult to assess this. Ultimately you should take a commonsense approach and refer the case to the specialist (assuming the client is eligible) if either:

* the client believes they have suffered alarm or distress, or
* taking into account the full circumstances you consider that they may have been caused alarm and distress

###Common potential scenarios

* a neighbour is being racially abusive
* a neighbour is verbally abusing the client or their children or partner
* the client's property or belongings are being damaged and they know who is doing it
* extreme and purposeful noise nuisance is causing the client alarm or distress
* the client has experienced violence or threats of violence on more than one occasion
* someone is using animals to make the client or the client's family afraid
* someone is purposefully taking actions to wilfully or knowingly cause the client distress, or actions that the perpetrator should know would cause alarm or distress
* the landlord is harassing the client
