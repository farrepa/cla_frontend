Legal aid is available to apply for an injunction or restraining order to protect someone who lives in rented property from harassment. 

To identify whether the call is in scope, you must decide if what the client is describing amounts to harassment and the key points to look out for are:

* the perpetrator's actions are causing the client alarm or distress
* the client is in fear of violence
* the harassment must have occurred on AT LEAST TWO occasions

The definition of "causing alarm and distress" can be very subjective, so you should apply a commonsense approach and consider whether the behaviour would cause any reasonable person alarm or distress.
