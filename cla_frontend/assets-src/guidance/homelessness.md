Local authorities have a statutory obligation to provide accommodation and assistance to an individual who is homeless or threatened with homelessness (i.e. will become homeless within 28 days)

To be in scope the client will currently be homeless or have been threatened with losing their home within 28 days and need to access accommodation and/or assistance from the local housing authority.

Alternatively, they may have received a letter from the local authority on their ineligibility for accommodation and assistance that they wish to challenge.

Are you homeless or are you threatened with homelessness within the next 28 days? You will be considered as homeless if you:

* have no accommodation physically available to occupy in the UK or elsewhere, or
* have no accommodation available which you are legally entitled to occupy, or
* have accommodation which is available and which you are entitled to occupy but cannot secure entry into it, or
* have accommodation available which you are entitled to occupy, but that accommodation consists of a moveable structure and there is no place where you are entitled or permitted both to place and reside in it, or
* have accommodation available, which you are entitled to occupy and it is not reasonable to continue to occupy
