##Questions that may help you identify "in scope" matters

* what type of refuge or shelter are you living in?
* have you been subjected to any violence or threats of violence in your home?
* is your home in a state of serious disrepair? If so, is this affecting your health?
* how many people live in your property (specify ages and gender)
* how many rooms are there, not counting the kitchen and bathroom?
* do you have anywhere else to stay? If yes, how long can you stay there? Do you own that property? Is it in the UK?
* do you have anywhere you can legally moor your boat?
* do you have anywhere you can legally pitch your caravan?
* have you received a section 184 letter? (homeless decision letter)

###For people with health conditions and disabled people

* can you access the property without help?
* is the layout of the property suitable for your needs?

## Common scenarios

### Already homeless

* homeless, living on the street
* living in women's refuge
* living in a night shelter

### At risk of homelessness

* housed, but being subjected to violence or threats of violence
* housed, but property has been condemned due to disrepair
* housed, but property has repair issues that are affecting client's health
* housed, but property is causing health issues
* housed, but client can't get in or out, or use the property's facilities properly (eg wheelchair user housed in building with broken lift)

### Other

* due to flood, fire or other disaster, the client can't live in the property
* statutory overcrowding
* client has caravan or boat but nowhere they can legally place it
* partner has evicted client from the property
* client wants to challenge the suitability of accommodation offered under homelessness legislation - this could be in the final discharge of duty (permanent accommodation), temporary or interim (emergency accommodation)
