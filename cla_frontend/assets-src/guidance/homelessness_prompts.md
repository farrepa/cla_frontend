##Questions that may help you identify "in scope" matters

* Where are you staying tonight?
* Why canâ€™t you stay where you have been living? 
* Is where you are staying suitable for your needs?
* Have you made a homeless application to the council? What is the status of this application?
* Are you seeking asylum? Are you at risk of losing your accommodation?

###For people with health conditions and disabled people

* can you access the property without help?
* is the layout of the property suitable for your needs?

## Common scenarios

### Already homeless

* homeless, living on the street
* living in women's refuge
* living in a night shelter

### At risk of homelessness

* housed, but being subjected to violence or threats of violence
* housed, but property has been condemned due to disrepair
* housed, but property has repair issues that are affecting client's health
* housed, but property is causing health issues
* housed, but client can't get in or out, or use the property's facilities properly (eg wheelchair user housed in building with broken lift)

### Other

* due to flood, fire or other disaster, the client can't live in the property
* statutory overcrowding
* client has caravan or boat but nowhere they can legally place it
* partner has evicted client from the property
* client wants to challenge the suitability of accommodation offered under homelessness legislation - this could be in the final discharge of duty (permanent accommodation), temporary or interim (emergency accommodation)
