##Housing disrepair

For housing disrepair to apply, the client must live in a rented home and there must be a problem with the accommodation that poses a serious risk of harm to the health and safety of the client or their family. 

However, the specialist will assess whether the housing problem poses a serious risk to health and safety - operators do not have to do this. 

If the client has reported a health and safety issue to the landlord and no action or insufficient action has been taken to resolve this, the issue will be in scope. 

Please note: it is not necessary for the client or their family to be suffering an illness or injury as a result of the housing disrepair for the problem to be in scope. 

However, the client or their family must have some evidence of the housing disrepair - either photographs or a report from a surveyor.
