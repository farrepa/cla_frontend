An injunction is a court order that tells a person they're not allowed to do a certain act. An injunction is usually applied for when a relationship has broken down and one party is harassing, threatening or assaulting the other.

There are two forms of injunctions: 
* non-molestation orders
* occupation orders

###Non-molestation orders

A non-molestation order is a court order to stop your partner molesting you or your children. Molesting means harassing, pestering or interfering with you or your children in some way, and also includes assault.

###Occupation orders
An occupation order is a court order that decides who should carry on living in the home in the short term after there has been violence or harassment in a relationship. 

Legal Aid is available for perpetrators of domestic abuse to defend themselves against an application for these orders.
