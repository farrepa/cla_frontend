# Means assessments for children under 18

A child under 18 is subject to the same means assessment as an adult. 

In general, if a child has no income, we would normally assess the means of the parents or guardian unless it would be unfair to do so.

Circumstances where we would not assess the parent or guardian include (but are not limited to) cases where:

* the child has an income of their own or is otherwise supporting themselves
* there is a conflict of interest with the person who normally supports the child
* the child is a ‘looked after’ child (in local authority care) - for these cases we only assess the child and not the local authority, social worker or foster carer

* the child is represented by a children’s guardian or litigation friend – for these cases we also only assess the child

Assessing only the child’s means can often lead to a ‘nil’ assessment but the means assessment must still take place.
