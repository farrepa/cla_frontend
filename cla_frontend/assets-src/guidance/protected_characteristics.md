##What are the protected characteristics?

It is unlawful to discriminate against anyone on the grounds of:

* age
* gender reassignment
* being married or in a civil partnership
* pregnancy or maternity
* disability
* race including colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin
* religion, belief or lack of religion or belief
* sex
* sexual orientation



###Age
Age discrimination might be against to a person belonging to a particular age group (eg 20-year-olds) or a range of ages (eg 60 to 80-year-olds).

###Gender reassignment
It is unlawful to discriminate against someone due to their gender reassignment.
This includes where someone:

* is proposing to undergo gender reassignment or
* is currently undergoing gender reassignment or
* has already undergone (or partially undergone) the process of gender reassignment

###Pregnancy or maternity
It is unlawful to discriminate against someone on the grounds of pregnancy, or if they've recently given birth. This can include the need to breastfeed. 

###Disability
A disability is defined as a physical or mental impairment that has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on a person's ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities.

“Substantial” means more than trivial (eg needing help with having a wash, showering, shopping etc)
"Long term" is where a condition has lasted, or is likely to last, more than 12 months (so for example someone may have had a back problem for less than 12 months but the client may think this is likely to continue).

People with cancer or who are HIV+ are classed as having a disability.

The disability does not have to have a name or an official diagnosis to satisfy the definition.

###Marriage and civil partnership
It is unlawful to discriminate against people who are married or in a civil partnership, including same sex couples

###Race
It is unlawful to discriminate against people because of their race, colour or nationality (including citizenship), ethnic or national origins.

###Religion or belief
Religion means any religious or philosophical belief, including a lack of religious belief (eg atheism). Generally, a belief should affect your life choices or the way you live for it to be included in the definition of religion. 

###Sex
It is unlawful to discriminate against anyone because they are a man or a woman. 

###Sexual orientation
Sexual orientation is Whether a person is sexually attracted to their own sex, the opposite sex or to both sexes.
This can also cover situations where discrimination is based on what someone perceives another person's sexual orientation to be, even when this is not the case.
