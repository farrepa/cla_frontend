##Special Educational Needs (SEN)
Where a caller tells you about a child or young person with special educational needs who has a problem that relates to education in any way - eg bullying, exclusion, transport or admission problems - the problem is in scope.

Legal aid is available for all advice and assistance about the provision of educational services to a child with special education needs (SEN). This would cover situations where the client:

* thinks that their child has SEN that are not being addressed by their school or local authority
* objects to or is disputing a Statement of SEN
* does not agree with what the Statement of SEN says in terms of their child's specific needs and their learning difficulties. This would cover disputes about the type of special education that would meet their child's needs (eg facilities, therapy, staffing, monitoring arrangments and any non-educational requirements like specialist transport). 
* believes that the school or local authority is not meeting the child's needs as set out in the Statement

A child or student with SEN is some who:

a) is under 19 and
b) has a significantly greater difficulty in learning than the majority of pupils of their age or has a disability which means that they can't make full use of the general educational facilities provided for pupils of their age.

### Post-16 education
Legal aid is available for advice in relation to a local authority's assessment (or lack of assessment) of a young person's post-16 educational requirements and support. This could include helping them make a complaint to the local authority or the Local Government Ombudsman, or, if the circumstances justify it, lodging an application for judicial review.
