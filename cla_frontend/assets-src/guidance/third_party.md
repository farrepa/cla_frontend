## Third Party

Where someone states that they are calling on behalf of another person and are authorised to act on their behalf you must first:

### Check whether the client is resident in the EU. 
Please ask: _Does the person you are calling on behalf of live in England or Wales?_

If 'Yes' continue with call. 
If 'No' please ask: _Does the person you are calling on behalf of live within the EU?_

If 'Yes', continue.
If 'No', this case will need to be treated as **out of scope**.

### Capture details 
Once you have confirmed the client lives within the EU please:

* Take the details of the Client and then
* Take the details of the Third Party.

You should also ask for a reason why the client wants them to act on their behalf and note this.

You must ask in what capacity the Third Party is acting and note this.

Where the Third Party is a legal advisor you must note the name of the organisation that they work for.

### Authority
Where possible you must ask to speak to the client to confirm that they are happy for the Third Party to speak on their behalf and agree a passphrase.

You must record the passphrase on the system. Where a Third Party contacts the service again they must confirm the password.

### If you cannot speak to the Client 

If you cannot speak to the Client, you should check whether this is because they are:
* under 18;
* a patient;
* subject to Power Of Attorney;
* Or there is a valid reason why they cannot communicate via the phone (e.g. speech impediment).

Unless one of these reasons applies you should ask the Third Party to contact the service again or offer to call them back at a time when you can speak to the Client.
