##What to say if a client asks why you are unable to help them.

If a client asks why you are unable to help them, please say something along the lines:

* The Legal Aid Agency is responsible for the administration of Legal Aid in England and Wales. The agency is bound by legislation and has no discrition in how this is applied.
* More information can be found gere/l https://www.justice.gov.uk/youth-justice/courts-and-orders/legal-aid-sentencing-and-punishment-of-offenders-act-2012

* If asked: The introduction of the Legal Aid Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (LASPO) revised the scope of legal aid available for civil cases. If you feel that your case may fall of this legislation then you may wish to apply for exceptional case funding.

##What to say if a client wishes to know why they aren't financially eligible.

*Some clients may wish to know why they aren't eligible. If a client has a significatn amount of capital and high earnings, it may be appropriate to inform them that their house is worth too much, or their gross income exceeds the limit.*

*However, we would want to avoid detailed conversations about the various allowances.*
